We are just trying to be transparent:The owners are extremely busy and we want to be respectful to them, as well as prospective buyers.So if you're flaky, or need a week to talk to your wife, or aren't liquid enough to do the deal, there is no need to apply (respectfully). It will not be a good use of time for you, or the owners.We are looking for a buyer who is ready to move with speed (after they verify our business of course).After you apply, we will send you all of the information upfront.

You can also see one of the warehouses from our network which are being used for FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant).The rest of the fulfillment is directly through FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon).Using hybrid fulfillment models has allowed us to get this Amazon business, and multiple other stores long ahead of the competition, while maintaining sustainability and growth for the long term.This business is relocatable, and completely remote, even though it is backed by many brick and mortar assets and services which our fulfilled remotely by our vendor network.The only thing that needs to be added is your information.

The latest ownership of Blonde Bar decided to end its 23 year tenure (previously Bar Dynamite) in 2020 due to COVID-19. The ownership of the property is looking for an individual or group to come in and take the bar to the next level bringing in a fresh look and concept (no dive bar/live bands). There's a huge drawing card having nationally recognized Lucha Libre Taco Shop right next door adding heavy foot traffic to an already high vehicular traffic count. On the other bookend you have Palomar Market that was established back in 1927 with only its second ownership and Yoshino's Japanese Restaurant that has been around since the late 70's. There's a considerable amount of parking available in the lot adjacent to the bar plus extensive on-street parking as well. Mission Hills is a very well known area for some of the best restaurants and bars in San Diego.There are two separate parts to this transaction. The ownership of the property is looking to lease the location (10-year+10-year option) Negotiable $3.50/sq.ft. + NNN (Approx $1875/mn incl. prop taxes/insurance/water&sewer/trash/maintenance/pest control/etc). The second part of the transaction is if you wish to obtain the existing type 48 license from the prior bar ownership they're willing to sell it for a non-negotiable $160,000. They're willing to finance subject to credit approval. The benefit of obtaining the existing license is streamlining the application process. As long as you have a clean criminal record and financials it will save you at least 9-12 months of application processing time and a very minimal review time with state and local agencies. We're looking for an individual or group that is financially stable, not empty pockets with hopes and dreams. Before any serious lease negotiations are conducted you will be asked to provide financials so that we don't waste each others time. The ownership of the property took the opportunity with the vacant space to open up the ceiling and expose all of the plumbing for the four residential units directly above and install new wool insulation which is the ground work for sound proofing and climate control. The ceiling has been left exposed otherwise so that the new tenant can install whatever electrical/lighting/sound/HVAC they wish. The bar has a large walk-in, ice machine, HVAC, and 2 bathrooms.Please contact Peter @ 858-775-4246 ZVK Property Mgmt to inquire about the location and schedule a walk-through of the location.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n""]","['\nLocation:\nSan Diego, CA\nReal Estate:\nLeased\nBuilding SF:\n1,511\nLease Expiration:\nN/A\n']","

The Company has years of experience in PPO.  The business model generates recurring revenue and the technology allows the subscribing clients to customize the network to fit their own needs. The Company also offers several re-pricing options to payers. The Company reviews provider performance to assure compliance with the network’s evidence-based treatment guidelines, improving outcomes and offers metrics germane to the medical treatment within the network, allowing payers to monitor performance.The Company is a resource for Group Medical Insurance Providers and Payers, and for Workers Comp Payers to create a custom network of highly qualified medical providers, specific to California. The Company’s network and technology allow Payers and Employers to tailor their network to their own specific needs. The payers subscribe to the Company’s network generating recurring revenue for the Company.NOTE: This is a re-listing of a major purchase opportunity for a rapidly expanding, profitable California medical network.The initial response to the original listing of this opportunity was huge. A large investment group signed a Letter of Intent To Purchase early on, thus removing the opportunity from the marketplace. The holder of the LOI, following numerous delays over many months, was unable to proceed due to unexpected internal problems separate from their signing the LOI or their completed due diligence. Therefore, this terrific opportunity is now again available for purchase.Our Client’s business and profits continue to expand.  They have re-listed this purchase opportunity at $3M (USD). This sale price, based on current revenues, growth and profits, should be recovered by a Buyer in short order.Please do not respond to this opportunity unless you will provide proof of funds prior to any demos or negotiations; i.e. the capability to make an acquisition of $3M dollar (USD). The Seller only wishes to work with interested Buyers who, once they are satisfied with their due diligence, are prepared to proceed immediately.

There are currently about 3 CBD companies that hold the majority of the market share, leaving plenty of room for other brands to make their way to the top.

The portfolio can be sold in its entirety or in part.Studio locations are as follows:  Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Diego.These Franchise opportunities are differentiated as follows:• A franchisor who has decades of experience in fitness and franchising.   • They excel in generating strong brand awareness in every market with robust national brand advertising.• They leverage the best resources available to provide superior franchisee support across every department, including a 100% E-commerce platform.• Their operational excellence ensures impressive unit-level economics.• They execute local studio marketing and sales strategies to create community engagement and drive memberships.Acquisition BenefitsThe right franchise Buyer will inherit: • Strong brand name recognition.• An existing member base (as opposed to starting a new studio) and competing effectively for market share in a solidly growing industry in the US.• Excellent support and outstanding growth potential.• A fully operational fitness studio, or a collection of studios, at a steep discount.Growth opportunities include:• Develop a robust recurring revenue stream.• Continue expansion by acquiring additional available franchise locations.• Own an opportunity that can easily be semi-absentee, manager-run.The MarketAccording to a recent IBISWorld Industry Report, the Gym, Health and Fitness Clubs industry has benefited from the health of the broader economy and growth in health-consciousness over most of the five years to 2021.

Overall, monthly memberships with low cancellation fees have fared well during most of the period.The number of adults aged 20 to 64, the largest gym-going demographic, has expanded over the past five years, spurring demand for gym memberships. To the industry's detriment, the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic had forced industry operators to temporarily close their doors, hurting industry revenue. Nevertheless, as the pandemic subsides, industry establishments have reopened. Thus, industry revenue has remained stable at $37.0 billion over the five years to 2021, including growth of 7.2% in 2021 alone. However, industry profit has declined during the same period. Growing consumer demand for low-cost monthly memberships has constrained profit for gyms with low member retention rates because this type of business model typically requires a higher volume of subscr\r\n    \r\n    \r\n""]","['\nLocation:\nSan Diego, CA\n']","
